Compiling & Running from the command line
========================

1- Install Maven: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
(Download binaries and copy to Applications folder)

2- Modify the file maven_startup.sh (which you find it in the root project folder) and fix the path of your maven (Line 5) and java installation (Line 9).

3- Create (or modify if already exist) a file ".profile" or ".bash_profile" in you home directory and add the following line,
which points to file "maven_startup.sh"

        source <project-folder>/maven_startup.sh

 Now after restarting the terminal, mvn should work.


4- The script "compile.sh" (which you find it in the root project folder) just compile the whole project and create a .jar file in the ./target folder.


5- The script "run.sh" (which you find it in the root project folder) should be used to run some class. For example,

        ./run.sh eu.amidst.core.examples.learning.ParallelMaximumLikelihoodExample
